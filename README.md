AI in healthcare uses machine learning to analyze data from patient records, imaging, and wearables. It detects diseases early, personalizes treatments, and predicts patient outcomes. AI also helps hospitals manage resources and supports preventive care through wearable .  AI requires ethical data handling for privacy and fairness.
1. Predictive Diagnostics:
AI models trained on medical data, such as lab results, patient histories, and imaging data, can predict the likelihood of diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. For instance, algorithms analyze risk factors and historical data to estimate a patientâ€™s probability of developing a condition, allowing for proactive management.

2. Early Disease Detection:
AI can detect early signs of diseases that may not be evident to human eyes. In radiology, for example, deep learning models analyze imaging scans (like X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans) to identify abnormalities, such as tumors, before they become symptomatic, improving early intervention.

3.Used Streamlit for predictions:
Show Predictions: Pass inputs to your model and display predictions with st.write().
Provide Advice: Display tailored lifestyle recommendations based on prediction outcomes.

Conlusion:
In summary, AI-powered healthcare predictions offer transformative benefits by enabling early disease detection, personalized treatment, and efficient hospital resource management. From analyzing imaging and patient data to monitoring chronic conditions and aiding drug discovery, AI supports proactive and tailored healthcare approaches. However, responsible data handling and ethical considerations remain essential for ensuring patient privacy and fairness in AI applications.
